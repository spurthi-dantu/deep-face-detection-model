# deep-face-detection-model

Developed a real‚Äêtime deep face detection model using annotated webcam images via LabelMe.
Employed Albumentations for data augmentation and OpenCV techniques for preprocessing. 
Utilized a pretrained VGG16 CNN model for accurate object classification and bounding box prediction, ensuring robust face detection.
